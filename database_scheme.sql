-- one table is created for each member, with the table name being the member's ID
-- The member ID is the character's 1-indexed position in official order, plus a number for the group they're in:
-- 0: Âµ's, 100: Aqours, 200: Nijigaku
-- So for example, Kanan is the third member in Aqours => 100 + 3 = 103

-- Indexes are created for each table for each key to speed up lookups
